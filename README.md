# JigitalclouN-LABProject

JigitalclouN is an international server rental services provider that also sells the server hardware used to host the servers. As a successful international company, JigitalclouN always manages to find the most strategic yet economic locations all around the world to place their servers. Therefore, it requires an efficient data management system to store and manage all its data, especially regarding the server rental transactions which happen all the time and the server sales which occur a bit less often but are still complicated to manage.
